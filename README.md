# hireme

An agentic tool with a theoretical 6767% effectiveness at getting a qualified candidate hired.

A local desk for a large set of job applications. Each application is a card. Focusing a card opens a side pane. Fullscreening that pane opens the application's battleplan. The interaction follows the same grid rule as a card browser: `h` `j` `k` `l` or the arrows, edge clamped. `Enter` opens the battleplan. `Esc` steps back, then clears search. `/` focuses search.

SQLite holds the corpus, a per-application mask over that corpus, batches, a scoreboard snapshot, and a private narrative. The narrative is one text blob per user, with a version and `updated_at`. It is not the root CV and it is not a mask. Application export omits it while it is private, which is the default.

## Run

Elixir 1.17+ and Erlang/OTP 27+.

```bash
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

Open http://localhost:4000.

`mix ecto.reset` rebuilds the database and loads `seed/` when that directory is present.

## `seed/`

Local data lives in `seed/` at the repository root. That directory is not in the gitignore whitelist, so Git does not track it. Put a profile, narrative, CV items, and import packs there. Nothing in `seed/` is committed.

`mix ecto.setup` reads these files when they exist:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `seed/profile.json` | User and profile: `slug`, `name`, `email`, `headline`, `summary`, optional `kv` object |
| `seed/narrative.md` | Private narrative body |
| `seed/items.json` | Corpus lines: `kind`, `key`, `title`, `body`, optional `org`, `span`, `position`, `profile` (`shared` or omitted for the profile) |
| `seed/overlay.json` | Optional one-line mask on a packed application |
| `seed/*.json`, `seed/*.md` | Packs, in the order listed in `seed/manifest.json` |

`seed/manifest.json` is a JSON list of filenames in `seed/` to import after the profile (batch packs, a pursue table, a freshness note, a scoreboard snapshot, claims).

`seed/overlay.json` fields: `batch`, `item_key`, `mode` (`altered`, `hidden`, or `emphasized`), optional `body`, `reason`, and `theme`.

## Import

`mix hireme.import PATH` is idempotent on the canonical job URL: lowercased host, no tracking query, no trailing slash. A second import updates the same card.

Shapes:

- Batch pack: `{batch, status, fire, queued_on, squad, apps: [...]}`
- Batch list: `{"batches": [...]}`
- Scoreboard snapshot: `{noted_on, leftover_unique, target_total, target_on, daily_batches, daily_apps}`
- Claims: `{"claims": [{"squad", "slice", "note"}]}`
- Pursue table: a markdown table with columns Company, Role, Location, Fit, Source, URL
- Freshness note: lines `OPEN n`, `THIN n`, `CLOSED n`, `BLOCKED n`, then `## OPEN` (and the other verdicts) as URL lists

A row marked `submitted` or `open_fire` is stored as `fire_ready` while that batch is on hold.

## Battleplan

Discovered, freshness, gated, in batch, draft ready, fire ready, open fire, submitted, reply, closed.

Freshness (`open`, `thin`, `closed`, `blocked`) and the gate (`pursue`, `maybe`, `skip`) are fields on the card. One stage is active. `open_fire` and `submitted` are refused while the batch fire is hold. Naming open fire records that decision. It does not send an application.

The scoreboard reads leftover URL counts from the latest snapshot, then counts batches and applications queued today, submits today, the cumulative submit count, and pace against the snapshot's daily target. Variety flags are computed per batch.
